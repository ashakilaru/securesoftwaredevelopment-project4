Initialize Client
Initialize Server

// Step 1: Client requests a secure connection
Client -> Server: "Hello, Server. Requesting TLS connection"

// Step 2: Server sends its certificate
Server -> Client: Send digital certificate (signed by CA)

// Step 3: Client validates the server certificate
If certificate is valid and signed by trusted CA:
    Proceed to key exchange
Else:
    Terminate connection
    Log security warning

// Step 4: TLS Handshake (Key Exchange)
Client generates Pre-Master Secret
Client encrypts Pre-Master Secret with Server Public Key
Client -> Server: Send encrypted Pre-Master Secret

Server decrypts Pre-Master Secret using Private Key
Both Client and Server generate Session Key from Pre-Master Secret

// Step 5: Secure Communication
Client <-> Server: Encrypt and decrypt messages using Session Key
Ensure message integrity using HMAC

End Secure Session
